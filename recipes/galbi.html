          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time.</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
              <li>¾ cup water</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
              <li>½ large onion, minced</li>
              <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
              <li>¼ cup dark brown sugar</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
              <li>3 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick across bones)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve. Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.</li>
              <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
              <li>Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.</li>
              <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li>
          </ol>
